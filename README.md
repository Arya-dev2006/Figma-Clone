# Figma Clone (Vanilla JS)

A Figma-like design editor built using **HTML, SCSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.

This project is built from scratch without frameworks to deeply understand:
- Single Page Application (SPA) architecture
- Manual routing using URL hash
- Global state management
- State persistence using localStorage
- DOM-driven UI rendering

## Current Features
- Landing page and editor views
- Hash-based SPA routing (no page reload)
- Global application state
- Persistent state using localStorage

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- SCSS (compiled to CSS)
- Vanilla JavaScript

## Project Goal
To understand how modern tools like Figma and React-based apps work internally by building the core logic manually.

## Status
🚧 Work in progress
